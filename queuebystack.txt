TO IMPLEMENT A QUEUE USING 2 STACKS

-Let the queue to be implemented be q. The stacks used to implement this are stackA and stackB
-Suppose a new element is to be added to q. The new element is entered at the top of stackA. 
-To remove an element from the front, if stackb is empty, then all the elements are moved to stackB and finally top of stackB is returned.

enqueue(q,  val)
   -Pushes val to stackA

dequeue(q)
  -If both stacks are empty then, then there is an underflow.
  -If stackB is empty:
       While stackA is not empty, push everything from stackA to stackB.
  -Pop the element from stackB and return it.
