APPLICATIONS OF STACK:
1)Used to evaluate infix, prefix, and postfix expressions and convert one form to the other.
2)It is used for parenthesis checking.
3) Backtracking of processes is possible by using stack.
4)The concept of stack is used in recursion.

APPLICATIONS OF QUEUE:
1)Handling of errors in a real-time scenario: The errors encountered first are resolved first (first come,first serve basis).
2)CPU task scheduling.
3)When data is transfered between two processes at two different speeds, queue is used to implement the faster one first. Ex: IO Buffers
